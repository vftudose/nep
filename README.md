You need docker to run the database and the backend. You can run the frontend with npm run serve directly in windows. You will need nodejs and npm for that.
The base url for the api is defined in main.js as 'http://localhost:8080/api' You will need to make sure this is correct when you'll run it on the local.
Also run migrate and db:seed. This will create two users and two projects and some tasks
